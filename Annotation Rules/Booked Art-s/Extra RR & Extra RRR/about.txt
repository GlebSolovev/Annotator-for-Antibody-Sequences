<< North, 2011 >> - "nowadays" article, improving number and accuracy of (Chothia latest) canonical structures
/and also gives some useful info about possible amino acids of positions located near CDRs
// written by North, Lehmann and Dunbrack Jr (?)
// improving number and accuracy of canonical structures due to a bigger data sets nowadays
/enough amount of ACCURATE (high-resolution) data (about 300 sequences for each CDR)
/for human, mouse, camel, llama (and other species?) - super useful!
/data from IMGT database^^
/commentaries about most of clusters for each CDR - ADD LATER (some useful info to distinguish them better)
// BUT! here definitions of CDRs are DIFFERENT from Kabat and Chothia - but they can be translated into required ones
/also comparison Chothia (and Martin and Thornton) canonical structures with theirs
/comparison with Morea et al. about H3
// also as CDR-definition image - Extra RR, i.e. positions located near CDRs boundaries and their possible amino acids
/useful, but inaccurate (because it's just image without any variability info)
// some Extra RR additions which help to define EACH CDR - super useful! (and very accurate)
// a table with comparison of the Kabat, Chothia, Martin and this work CDRs boundaries
/but probably the table is inaccurate so it's better to skip it
// so that because - Extra RR (positions located near CDRs and their possible amino acids)
/Extra RRR (highly accurate and detailed canonical structures BUT! some errors caused by translating their CDR definition into requred ones)
/ADD COMMENTARIES LATER - there is a lot of important info which migth make canonical structures algorithm really accurate!

//add numbers and renew records! NOW
