about:

<< Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 1983 >> - summarizing article about Kabat annotation
// by Kabat et al.
// consider original rules (boundaries and key residues)
/sets of V,D,J-genes for human, mice and rabbits (+other animals)
/a huge base of originally annotated sequences
/info about subgroups, families and allotypes + most common residues for each position for (each) subgroup
// so that because - boundaries and key residues, special commentaries, invariable residues for both chains

<< Kabat, 1970 >> - one of the earliest article about Kabat annotation
// by Kabat et al.
// have a lot of staticstics info about positions, BUT number of selection is too small - maximum only about 60-70 sequences
/info about Gly and invariant residues
// so that because - only boundaries and key residues for light chains; 
/info about invariant Gly (90%) and invariant residues in light chains

<< Kabat, 1971 >> - also one of the earliest article about Kabat annotation
// by Kabat et al.
// have some plots obtained from statistics resulting in some info about boundaries
/a lot of info about Gly
// so that because - only boundaries and info about invariant Gly for heavy chains

<< Kabat Database, 2004 >> - about Kabat Database (now doesn't exist), a few summarized info about Kabat annotation
// by Johnson and Wu (Kabat's group)
// 99% of summarized info refs to observed articles (so it just repeats the previous info)
// so that because - useless
/plots that show hypervariable regions really well
