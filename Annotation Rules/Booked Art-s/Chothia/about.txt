<< Chothia, 1987 >> - the first article where Chothia annotation fully appears 
/(= corrections to Kabat annotation using thoughts about proteins' structure)
// by Chothia and Lesk
// analysing known structures (from Kabat's database (1983)) using some thoughts about proteins' structure 
/(bonds, angles and secondary structure elements)
/but these hypotheses can't be approved surely enough to use them as rules (small amount of data)
/also thoughts about protein structure don't help annotation as much here (+-)
// the "canonical structures" concept firstly appears
// only human and mouse sequnces
// about amount of data:
/some hypotheses are made only on small amounts of data (about 60 seq-s or even less!!! (3-4 structures))
/and some are made on big enough (sometimes so so) amounts of data (about 60-200 for VL and 200 for VH)
// so that because - some info CAN BE borrowed from this article:
/(about some secondary structure elements, their connection with lengths of CDRs)
/but in the later articles it will be more accurate!
/so - some info about positions and their possible residues, lengths of CDRs
/and the most important - the first version of Chothia annotation (boundaries)
/info about add-positions is not stated clearly (better in the later articles)

<< Chothia, 1989 >> - more about the canonical structures (accurate and structured info) for Vk and VH
// by Chothia et al.
// Chothia's team became convinced of the "canonical structures" concept 
/(that it works and exists for L1, L2, L3 and H1, H2)
/and suggested not many, but accurate canonical structures
/only for mice and humans
// so that because - the first canonical structures for Vk and VH of mice and humans
/(= the basis for the future wider canonical structures)
/new boundaries of H2 region
/and correct and accurate info about Chothia's add-positions

<< Chothia, 1992 >> - super detailed and more about (human) VH canonical structures (for H1 and H2 only of course)
/(3 canonical structures for H1 and 5 for H2)
/distinguishing into classes and families ("canonical structure classes" - new concept)
// by Chothia et al.
// brief, accurate and detailed about CDRs and their boundaries considering in terms of protein structure
/(+ new boundary of H2)
// also accurate and clear about each cannonical structure
/most of these commentaries are already included directly in the info about the canonical structures
/but they can be checked again later
// detailed examples to each canonical structure class
/ + 83 VH segments (74, most of them) distinguished into classes and families (with their full seq-s)
// the question of the stability of the V-domain appears (which residues, positions do provide stability to the V-domain?)
/the role of different positions of CDRs in determinig protein structure 
// based on 83 VH segments with open reading frames, only for human
/6 VH families (refs to Kodaira et al. 1986, Buluwela & Rabbits 1988 and others)
/about 31-insertions and Fab fragment of AN02 (refs to Brunger et al. 1991)
/a lot of refs to Tramontano et al. 1990 throughout the article (about canonical structures)
// so that because - CDRs boundaries, canonical structures distinguished into families and classes for human H1 and H2
/+right gaps for the 31, 52 add-positons => for the right numbering

<< Tomlinson, 1995 >> - super detailed, accurate (clear) and more about human Vk canonical structures (for L1, L2 and L3)
// by Tomlinson, Cox, Gherardi, Lesk and Chothia
// 736 rearranged Vk genes 
// 30-40 functional Vk segments, germlines without errors for one human individual
/ 32 annotated human germlines, distinguished into 6 subgroups (with full sequences)
// detailed about each human canonical structure for L1, L2 and L3 (with lengths, key residues, gaps and frequencies of appearing)
/also detailed about their somatic mutations at the key sites (conservative and non-conservative)
/most (almost all) of these commentaries are already included directly in the info about the canonical structures
/but they can be checked again later
// L1, L2 and L3 boundaries
// 4 cs for L1, 1 cs for L2 and 3 cs for L3 (all for human)
/about full repertoire of canonical structures for Vk: (refs to Brunger et al. 1991, He et al. 1992 and others (of course to Chothia, see above))
// so that because - L1, L2 and L3 boundaries and numbering; all human canonical structures for Vk
/each with detailed info: frequency, length, key residues, positions and their possible amino acids, examples

<< Al-Lazikani, 1997 >> - the latest (and the last original) version of the Chothia canonical structures for all chain types
/ for L1, L2 and L3 of Vk and V(lambda); for H1 and H2 of VH (+almost nothing about H3)
/but the amount of high resolution structures is not enough to see all the canonical structures!
// by Al-Lazikani, Lesk and Chothia
// 17 immunoglobulin structures accurately determined at high resolution = 79 hypervariable regions in all
/7 V(lambda), 10 Vk, 15 VH
// canonical structures for L1, L2 and L3 of Vk and V(lambda), for H1 and H2 of VH
/each with Kabat and Chothia numbering! => super useful information for the right numbering
/the most popular with the high resolution examples
/but the info about the others is NOT present in this article (at best - a lot of refs to another articles)
/also info about some hydrogen bonds and torsion angles (unused, because for now we don't know how to use it)
/commentary for each CDR (about protein structure), but not clear and messed-up with a lot of refs to other articles => 
/but all the useful info (existing there) was accurately obtained
/only human/not-human marking (and not for all CDRs)
// the latest CDRs boundaries for L1, L2, L3 (of V(lambda) and Vk, they differs!!!) and for H1, H2
// see refs: 
/(Tomlinson et al. 1995 on the Vk structures; Wu & Crygler 1993 on the V(lambda) and others (some are ment above))
/Martin & Thornton, 1996 about clusters (another concept improving the idea of canonical structures)
/Bruger et al. 1991, He et al. 1992 and Guarne et al. 1996 (cs #6 - the new one) - about L3 Vk canonical structures
/Shirai et al. 1996, Martin & Thornton 1996 and Morea et al. 1997 - about H3
// so that because - 
/the latest CDR boundaries and CDR numbering => super useful!
/but for H3 it's NOT stated clearly - 95-102 (similar to Kabat) or 96-101 (in some other nowadays sources)
/all the Chothia canonical structures named and have their numbering scheme => useful!
/but for a lot of them there isn't any clear examples, info - only a lot of refs to another articles

<< Guarne, 1996 >> - about (the new found one (on that moment)) canonical structure 6 for L3 of Vk
// by Guarne et al. (?)
// canonical structure without key Proline at 94 or 95 positions
// significant for some murine immunoglobulins (10% of their Vk)
// brief but clear and accurate about L3 Vk (and several words about V(lambda)) canonical structures
// so that because - a brief info about Vk canonical structures 
/and the most important - canonical structure 6 for L3 of Vk (mourine)
