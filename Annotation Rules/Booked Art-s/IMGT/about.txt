about:

<< IMGT-Booklet, 2011 >> - the latest and the resulting IMGT atricle about all their system, brief and informative
// by Lefranc et al.
// briefly about IMGT main concepts and software (ref. to a lot of Lefranc articles)
// also short&sweet about IMGT UNIQUE NUMBERING FOR V DOMAIN - main information from Lefranc et al. 2003
// so that because - all IMGT annotation rules (numbering, boundaries, conserved residues, gaps and additional positions)
/also all obtained info was checked on human germlines (from V-base) (and was made more accurate)
/be careful! some info is now absence (ADD LATER) about: 
<< 29, IMGT-Booklet >> the composition of “CDR3-IMGT” is different depending on whether the sequence is germline or rearranged

add more articles! (check IMGT-Booklet more properly for more ref-s)
// Lefranc 1997, 1999; Lefranc et al. 2003
/The “FR-IMGT” and “CDR-IMGT” concepts allow one to describe the framework regions and complementarity
determining regions, respectively, based on the IMGT unique numbering (...)
/1997 and 1999 - the first ones; 2003 - best about V-DOMAIN
// check again other IMGT concepts in the IMGT-Booklet
// Lefranc and Lefranc 2001 a,b
/the composition of “CDR3-IMGT” is
different depending on whether the sequence is germline or rearranged

System

/The NUMEROTATION axiom is an axiom of the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY or
IMGT-Kaleidoscope (...)
// Lefranc et al. 2009
/The NUMEROTATION axiom has generated the concepts
of numerotation of IMGT-ONTOLOGY, the global reference in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics,
built by IMGT (...)

/These conserved codons and amino acids and their mutations are identified and described
by IMGT/V-QUEST (...) (about 1st and 2nd CYS, conserved TRP etc.)
// Alamyar et al. 2010
/These conserved codons and amino acids and their mutations are identified and described
by IMGT/V-QUEST and IMGT/HighV-QUEST (...) for nucleotide sequences.
// Yousfi Monod et al. 2004; Bleakley et al. 2006
/The “2nd-CYS” 104 and “J-TRP” or “J-PHE” 118 (that belong to the FR3-IMGT and FR4-IMGT, respectively) are the anchors of
the rearranged CDR3-IMGT. They delimit the “JUNCTION”that spans 104 to 118 and includes them at
its ends (...)
