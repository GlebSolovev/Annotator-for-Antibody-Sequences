<< Chothia, 1998(All) >> - one of the latest atricle written by Chothia, highly accurate and super useful
// by Chothia et al.
// the main idea - to consider the conserved core (invariant sites, closely related and snb)
/that invariant in the almost most sequences
// dividing these positions into groups with their possible amino acids
/also mathematical variability of EACH amino acid - to ADD LATER in the scoring system << 6-9 >>
/the amount of data is big enough (5300 sequences), a lot of mathematical info in percents (variabilities)
/all info helps in all annotations! => super useful
/for all species! (human, mouse, rat, rabbit, shark and other species)
// so that because - invariant and closely related residues, positions with conserved snb groups
/positions of the core with their possible amino acids and numerical variabilities
/works for all sets of annotation rules!!! and for animals!
