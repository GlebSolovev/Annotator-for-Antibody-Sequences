about:

The main idea of my work is to use ALL the useful information from the original (and near) articles
of Kabat, Chothia and IMGT TOGETHER to make each annotation MORE ACCURATE.
Because the annotation of an antibody V-domain - Kabat, Chothia, IMGT, Martin etc. - annotates THE SAME SEQUENCE.
And the positions, their amino acids and structure conformation are also THE SAME.
So it's important to use information from all the articles together to make annotation more accurate.
// The more, all the scientists of that time were writing their articles in the context of the other works (of their colleagues),
i.e. all the science community which was solving the problem of annotation knew the same, common information 
which was complementing by each article of its member. 
So the science community of that time used all their information together too.

So...
Distinguishing these articles into different folders - it's just the way to make this small bibliotheque 
more comfortable to use.

Use all this articles, all this info together. And then add a bit of difference to obtain the needed annotation.
